# LightGBM in Machine Learning

LightGBM is a gradient boosting classifier in machine learning that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with faster drive speed and higher efficiency, lower memory usage and better accuracy.

LightGBM is a powerful machine learning model that can be shaped depending on the task you are working on.

But in general, LightGBM supports the following applications:

1. Classification
2. Regression
3. Binary classification
4. Multi-classification
5. Cross-entropy
